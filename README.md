pet project to understand how next.js fastify binding works :/ 

Only for archiving purposes, just a simple project, that prepares video (mp4, mkv (with audio track selection)) into hls stream.

Made with:
- Next.js 16
- Fastify
- React
- FFMpeg + Node.js workers

Can be vulnerable, due I dont give enough time for security, so if you will use it for any production stuff, check 100500 times, if it's worth it...

How to setup:
1. install deps `pnpm install`
2. run `pnpm dev`
